# Various Scripts by Josiah
This is a compilation of various scripts that I can share. I provide no warranty of them working, but I hope you can find something that will save you time in your own efforts. I'm releasing it using the MIT License to allow you to do just about anything you want with it. LICENSE.txt for more info.

## csvmaker.sh:
This is a simple script to take in a list of files from the command line and pump it into a csv file.

## id3Chapel.sh:
This was created for a project that was converting bible college chapels on tape masters to mp3 format. This script would take the name that was output in a certain format and create id3 tags from that information. (I worked a bit on porting this to ruby in id3Chapel.rb but didn't get far.)

## users.dhcp.sh:
I created this to make a report based on the dhcp leases in order to more easily grasp the information I needed to review.

## dhcp.awk:
This is used in users.dhcp.sh for processing dhcp leases. It is assumed to be in ~/scripts/bin. If you place it elsewhere, you'll need to edit users.dhcp.sh.

## house_use_bkgnd.sh:
This script grabs charts made is google spreadsheets and builds a background from them. I use this to keep my utility usage and other info in front of me. I apply the background to the machine that is connected to the TV for hulu and other media watching. A cron job can be used to make sure the data is constantly up-to-date. Copy the charts.cfg_example to charts.cfg and set those variables to make this work. This means building some charts in Google spreadsheets and then finding the image publishing URL.
